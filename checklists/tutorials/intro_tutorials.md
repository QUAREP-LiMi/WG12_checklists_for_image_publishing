# Introduction to tutorials

This tutorial shows in practice how to create an image figure for publication using [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/). The intention is to go with one example from original image to an image figure, including Figure legend and Methods that were used to created and process the images.  

For this tutorial you are going to need: 

- Fiji is just ImageJ (Fiji): [https://fiji.sc/](https://fiji.sc/)
- Image data: [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7642559)
- [Checklists](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01987-9)

## Checklist 

To help guide authors to create good image figures we have created a set of [Checklists](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01987-9). This tutorial is based on a condensed version of the checklist (see {ref}`figure-checklist`).

TODO: Explain the checklists and the condensed version. Provide an image. I would still think we need to modify the checklists in their sequence.
