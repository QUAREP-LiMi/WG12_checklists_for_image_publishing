  abstract = "Scientists routinely use images to display data. Readers often
              examine figures first; therefore, it is important that figures
              are accessible to a broad audience. Many resources discuss
              fraudulent image manipulation and technical specifications for
              image acquisition; however, data on the legibility and
              interpretability of images are scarce. We systematically examined
              these factors in non-blot images published in the top 15 journals
              in 3 fields; plant sciences, cell biology, and physiology (n =
              580 papers). Common problems included missing scale bars,
              misplaced or poorly marked insets, images or labels that were not
              accessible to colorblind readers, and insufficient explanations
              of colors, labels, annotations, or the species and tissue or
              object depicted in the image. Papers that met all good practice
              criteria examined for all image-based figures were uncommon
              (physiology 16\%, cell biology 12\%, plant sciences 2\%). We
              present detailed descriptions and visual examples to help
              scientists avoid common pitfalls when publishing images. Our
              recommendations address image magnification, scale information,
              insets, annotation, and color and may encourage discussion about
              quality standards for bioimage publishing.",

                   is currently undergoing rapid technological advancements.
                   However for scientists wishing to publish the obtained
                   images and image analyses results, there are to date no

                   interpret. Here we present community-developed checklists
                   for preparing light microscopy images and image analysis for
                   publications. These checklists offer authors, readers, and
                   publishers key recommendations for image formatting and
                   annotation, color selection, data availability, and for
                   reporting image analysis workflows. The goal of our
                   guidelines is to increase the clarity and reproducibility of
                   image figures and thereby heighten the quality of microscopy

              the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on
              enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use
              the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.
              This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR

@ARTICLE{Cromey2010-jr,
  title    = "Avoiding twisted pixels: ethical guidelines for the appropriate
              use and manipulation of scientific digital images",
  author   = "Cromey, Douglas W",
  abstract = "Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to
              acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult
              or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are
              easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged.
              One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital
              images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is
              twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional
              falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common
              unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for
              publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to
              address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines.
              Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with
              instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with
              what should or should not be done, but not the associated 'why'
              that is required for understanding the rules. This article
              proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation
              and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines.
              These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and
              graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and
              begin to bring an end to the culture of ``data beautification''.",
