# Introduction

Microscopy is a powerful tool to capture biological processes. The output of microscopy is image data (Figure 1). Publishing clear, informative microscopy figures is crucial for **life science researchers**, yet until now there have been no unified guidelines on how to do it. In response, members of **QUAREP-LiMi** (Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy) **Working Group 12** have created community-driven **checklists** to help you present images and image analysis results in a transparent and reproducible way.

Weâ€™ve defined three tiers of standards â€“ **Minimal** (essential requirements), **Recommended** (best practices for clarity), and **Ideal** (future goals) â€“ to guide you on [what to include when preparing microscopy figures](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10922596/). These checklists offer practical pointers on everything from image formatting and color choices to figure annotations (like scale bars or arrows) and even how to share your image data and analysis workflows.

By following this friendly guidance, you can remove the guesswork (and stress!) of figuring out whatâ€™s needed, and ensure your images are **more interpretable and reproducible** in the long run. Ultimately, **better-presented images mean better science** â€“ your findings will be clearer, more credible, and easier for others to build upon.

For practical instructions on how to implement these guidelines go to our [tutorials section](/tutorials/intro_tutorials.md)

## Join the Community and Contribute

This initiative is a community effort, and **early career researchers are especially welcome** to get involved. We encourage you to contribute new tutorials or examples, share your feedback, and ask questions.

- ðŸ’¬ Suggest improvements or submit examples on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QUAREP-LiMi/WG12_checklists_for_image_publishing)
- ðŸ§  Join the discussion on the [Image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/quarep)  
- ðŸ§ª Share your experience implementing the checklists

The WG12 team also welcomes new members â€“ together, we can continue refining the checklists and supporting one another in publishing high-quality images. For more details, see [How to contribute](/other_resources/how_to_contribute.md).
