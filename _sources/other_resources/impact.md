# Impact and Recognition

## Einstein Foundation award
Quality in research is a shared goal, and the impact of these guidelines is already being felt. Our work has even been recognized with the [Einstein Foundation’s Early Career Award for promoting quality in research](https://award.einsteinfoundation.de/award-winners-finalists/recipients-2024/pixelquality) – an honor received by WG12 co-chairs Dr. Helena Jambor and Dr. Christopher Schmied for their innovative work on these imaging guidelines.

## Springer Nature implementation
Springer Nature has also acknowledged our efforts, not only through publication of the initial checklist, but also through efforts to improve their own manuscript figure handling by implementing their own, related versions of these checklists. See the following three articles: 


*Nature Methods*
[Crediting early-career researchers in peer review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02738-8)

  "New cross-journal trial: light microscopy reporting checklist"
  "The checklist was developed by editors at Nature Cell Biology, Nature Communications, Nature Methods and Nature Structural and Molecular Biology with guidance from the international microscopy group QUAREP-LiMi and represents a minimal set of reporting requirements."


 *Nature Structural & Molecular Biology*
  [Reporting light microscopy data in our pages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-025-01605-6)
  
  "To conceive the table, we consulted researchers from QUAREP-LiMi and the published literature, together with editors across the Springer Nature portfolio."


*Nature Cell Biology*
  [Light microscopy reporting for reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01704-y)

  "Our multi-journal pilot will run for one year until June 2026. The reporting table is designed by Springer Nature editors for easy use and contains important details discussed with scientists from QUAREP-LiMi, the Consortium for Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments and Images in Light Microscopy."


## EMBO Press collaboration

  Additionally, members of Working Group 12 are involved in a discussion with [EMBO Press](https://www.embopress.org/) on how to implement an open source tool that will allow authors and reviewers to check images.
