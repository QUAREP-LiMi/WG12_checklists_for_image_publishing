# Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses

This JupyterBook is a dynamically updatable companion to the static Nature Methods publication [Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses](https://rdcu.be/dl9Z8){cite}`Schmied2023-oo`.

In this paper, members of [QUAREP-LiMi](./whois.md) have proposed 3 sets of standards for publishing image figures and image analysis - minimal requirements, recommended additions, and ideal comprehensive goals. By following this guidance, we hope to remove some of the stress non-experts may face in determining what they need to do, and we also believe that researchers will find their science more interpretable and more reproducible.

Alternatively, see the Einstein Foundation video below describing some of our work and goals.
